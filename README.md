# Overburden-Pressure-Calculation
This project is a Python-based tool designed for Petrophysicists and Drilling Engineers.
It automates the calculation of Overburden Stress (S_v), a critical input for:
• Wellbore Stability Analysis
• Fracture Gradient Prediction
• Reservoir Compaction Studies
Using raw well log data (Density RHOB and Depth TVD), the script cleans the data, handles missing values via interpolation, and performs a cumulative integration to generate a continuous stress profile
